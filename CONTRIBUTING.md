# Contributing

This is a branch new project, I'm working on setting this up.  I don't know
what the structure is yet, I just know I'd like more global thought.

Please don't rip out entire blog posts, or whole industry KPIs -- I'm
interested in a curated taxonomy of general SDLC KPIs that are reusable across
software development heavy industries interested in targeting [Agile
development
processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development#Agile_software_development_values)

## Pull Request Process

- For major structural changes or refactoring, please open a ticket to discuss
  it.
- For typos and minor fixes, please just send the PR.
- You may merge the PR once we decide what constitutes quorum of developers
